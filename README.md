# Vulkan examples built with Ash

This is a collection of some examples for [VulkanÂ®](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) that uses [Ash](https://github.com/ash-rs/ash) as its wrapper.

Each example is separated in a different folder and uses only the necessary crates to function. This has some drawbacks, but makes the functionality more apparent. All the examples follow a general module structure so you can just look at the functionality that you need.

Each folder has its own `README.md` which explains the general code flow, Vulkan functionality used and some differences / similarities to other examples.

Feel free to suggest new examples or improvements for old ones.

## Table of Contents

- [Instance creation](https://github.com/ZakStar17/ash-by-example/tree/main/instance): Covers Instance creation and enabling validation layers.
- [Device creation](https://github.com/ZakStar17/ash-by-example/tree/main/device): Covers physical device selection, logical device creation and queue retrieval.
- [Compute image clear](https://github.com/ZakStar17/ash-by-example/tree/main/compute_image_clear): Clears an image, copies it from device memory to host accessible (CPU) memory and saves it to a file. This example covers command buffer and image creation, image layout transitions with image barriers, queue family ownership transfer and queue submission.
- [Storage image compute shader](https://github.com/ZakStar17/ash-by-example/tree/main/storage_image_compute_shader): Generates the Mandelbrot Set offline by using a compute shader on a storage image. This example convers compute pipeline creation, pipeline caches, descriptor sets and compute shaders. This example also demonstrates the use of specialization constants in order to pass down constant values during pipeline creation.

This list is mostly ordered in terms of difficulty.

## Running

Running the examples requires the Rust toolchain as well as the [Vulkan SDK](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/).

To run a example with all validations enabled, navigate to the respective folder and run `RUST_LOG=debug cargo run <name_of_the_example>`. More information can be found in the respective README.

The examples use cargo features that enable specific functionality. These include `vl` to enable validation layers and `link` to link the Vulkan loader at compile time instead of loading it at runtime. In any case, using the default features should be enough.

## Checking the logs

Every example uses the [log](https://github.com/rust-lang/log) crate with [env_logger](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/) as its facade implementation. This means that, for example, the validation layers (if enabled) will only show errors by default.

Different levels of visibility can be changed with the environment variable `RUST_LOG`, so if
for example you want to see all error, warning, info and debug messages, just run the executable preceding
it with `RUST_LOG=debug`. You can find more information at [https://docs.rs/env_logger/0.11.0/env_logger/](https://docs.rs/env_logger/0.11.0/env_logger/).
